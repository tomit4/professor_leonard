In this lecture, we're really just going to practicing a lot of the Formulas
that we learned in the previous lecture on Double and Half Angle Formulas.

The most difficult part of this practice will really have to do with
understanding the Quadrant in which our point/angle resides. A lot of this will
become clear as we move forward through these exercises, so let's get started.

---

Consider the following:

$$ \cos\theta = \frac{3}{5} $$

Let's also say that you are given the following Domain Restriction:

$$ 0 < \theta < \frac{\pi}{2} $$

This automatically restricts us to Quandrant I.

This means that $\sin\theta$ and $\tan\theta$ will also be positive.

Let's now find $\sin\theta$ and $\tan\theta$ so we can then work through the
Double and Half Angle Formulas for $\theta$:

$$ \cos\theta = \frac{x}{r} $$

$$ x = 3 $$

$$ r = 5 $$

$$ y^2 + x^2 = r^2 $$

$$ y^2 + 3^2 = 5^2 $$

$$ y^2 + 9 = 25 $$

$$ y^2 = 16 $$

$$ y = \pm 4 $$

But we know that $y$ must be positive due to our Angle/Point being in Quadrant
I, so:

$$ y = 4 $$

We can now determine $\sin\theta$ and $\tan\theta$:

$$ \sin\theta = \frac{y}{r} $$

$$ \sin\theta = \frac{4}{5} $$

$$ \tan\theta = \frac{y}{x} $$

$$ \tan\theta = \frac{4}{3} $$

---

And now we can utilize these angles for our Double and Half Angle Formulas, for
reference here are our three Trigonometric Expressions:

$$ \sin\theta = \frac{4}{5} $$

$$ \cos\theta = \frac{3}{5} $$

$$ \tan\theta = \frac{4}{3} $$

---

Evaluate the following:

---

$$ \sin(2\theta) = \text{ ?} $$

$$ \sin(2\theta) = 2\sin\theta\cos\theta $$

$$ \sin(2\theta) = 2\left(\frac{4}{5}\right)\left(\frac{3}{5}\right) $$

$$ \sin(2\theta) = 2\left(\frac{12}{25}\right) $$

$$ \boxed{\sin(2\theta) = \left(\frac{24}{25}\right)} $$

---

$$ \cos(2\theta) = \text{ ?} $$

Now, we have multiple Cosine Double Formulas to choose from. Any will work, but
since we were given Cosine right off the bat, we might as well use that (in case
we might have calculated Sine or Tangent wrong).

$$ \cos(2\theta) = 2\cos^2\theta - 1 $$

$$ \cos(2\theta) = 2\left(\frac{3}{5}\right)^2 - 1 $$

$$ \cos(2\theta) = 2\left(\frac{9}{25}\right) - 1 $$

$$ \cos(2\theta) = \left(\frac{18}{25}\right) - 1 $$

$$ \boxed{\cos(2\theta) = -\frac{7}{25}} $$

---

$$ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = \text{ ?} $$

$$ \sin\left(\dfrac{\theta}{2}\right) = \pm \sqrt{\dfrac{1 - \cos\theta}{2}} $$

$$ \sin\left(\dfrac{\theta}{2}\right) = \pm \sqrt{\dfrac{1 - \dfrac{3}{5}}{2}} $$

$$ \sin\left(\dfrac{\theta}{2}\right) = \pm \sqrt{\dfrac{\dfrac{2}{5}}{2}} $$

$$ \sin\left(\dfrac{\theta}{2}\right) = \pm \sqrt{\dfrac{2}{10}} $$

$$ \sin\left(\dfrac{\theta}{2}\right) = \pm \sqrt{\dfrac{1}{5}} $$

$$ \sin\left(\dfrac{\theta}{2}\right) = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} $$

$$ \sin\left(\dfrac{\theta}{2}\right) = \pm \frac{\sqrt{5}}{5} $$

And because we established that our Angle/Point was in Quadrant I, we know that
this has to be positive. This is because if we divide our Domain by $2$, we
still get a positive domain for $\dfrac{\theta}{2}$:

$$ 0 < \frac{\theta}{2} < \frac{\pi}{4} $$

Therefore, our final answer to this Half-Angle Formula is:

$$ \boxed{\sin\left(\dfrac{\theta}{2}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{5}} $$

---

$$ \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = \text{ ?} $$

$$ \cos\left(\dfrac{\theta}{2}\right) = \pm \sqrt{\dfrac{1 + \cos\theta}{2}} $$

$$ \cos\left(\dfrac{\theta}{2}\right) = \pm \sqrt{\dfrac{1 + \dfrac{3}{5}}{2}} $$

$$ \cos\left(\dfrac{\theta}{2}\right) = \pm \sqrt{\dfrac{\dfrac{8}{5}}{2}} $$

$$ \cos\left(\dfrac{\theta}{2}\right) = \pm \sqrt{\dfrac{4}{5}} $$

$$ \cos\left(\dfrac{\theta}{2}\right) = \pm \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} $$

$$ \cos\left(\dfrac{\theta}{2}\right) = \pm \frac{2\sqrt{5}}{5} $$

And again, because our Domain is still positive (as covered previously with
Sine), we know that we are in Quadrant I and that this solution must be
positive:

$$ \boxed{\cos\left(\dfrac{\theta}{2}\right) = \frac{2\sqrt{5}}{5}} $$

---

$$ \tan(2\theta) = \text{ ?} $$

$$ \tan(2\theta) = \frac{2\tan\theta}{1 - \tan^2\theta} $$

$$ \tan(2\theta) = \frac{2\left(\dfrac{4}{3}\right)}{1 - \left(\dfrac{4}{3}\right)^2} $$

$$ \tan(2\theta) = \frac{\dfrac{8}{3}}{1 - \left(\dfrac{16}{9}\right)} $$

$$ \tan(2\theta) = \frac{\dfrac{8}{3}}{-\dfrac{7}{9}} $$

$$ \tan(2\theta) = \frac{8}{3} \cdot \left(-\frac{9}{7}\right) $$

$$ \tan(2\theta) = -\frac{72}{21} $$

$$ \boxed{\tan(2\theta) = -\frac{24}{7}} $$

Notice that we have a negative solution here, this is because when we double an
angle, we can _sometimes_, but not always, jump over into another quadrant.

---

$$ \tan\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = \text{ ?} $$

$$ \tan\left(\dfrac{\theta}{2}\right) = \pm \sqrt{\dfrac{1 - \cos\theta}{1 + \cos\theta}} $$

$$ \tan\left(\dfrac{\theta}{2}\right) = \pm \sqrt{\dfrac{1 - \dfrac{3}{5}}{1 + \dfrac{3}{5}}} $$

$$ \tan\left(\dfrac{\theta}{2}\right) = \pm \sqrt{\dfrac{\dfrac{2}{5}}{\dfrac{8}{5}}} $$

$$ \tan\left(\dfrac{\theta}{2}\right) = \pm \sqrt{\frac{2}{5} \cdot \frac{5}{8}} $$

$$ \tan\left(\dfrac{\theta}{2}\right) = \pm \sqrt{\frac{2}{8}} $$

$$ \tan\left(\dfrac{\theta}{2}\right) = \pm \sqrt{\frac{1}{4}} $$

$$ \tan\left(\dfrac{\theta}{2}\right) = \pm \frac{1}{2} $$

And we are still in Quadrant I and within positive territory, so we take the
positive answer:

$$ \boxed{\tan\left(\dfrac{\theta}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{2}} $$

---

Let's continue on now to another practice equation:

$$ \csc\theta = -\sqrt{5} $$

Our domain is restricted to:

$$ \cos\theta < 0 $$

Always take Reciprocal Trigonometric Functions and change them into
Trigonometric Functions when evaluating problems of these type:

$$ \csc\theta = -\sqrt{5} $$

$$ \sin\theta = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} $$

$$ \sin\theta = -\frac{\sqrt{5}}{5} $$

We know that Sine is negative in Quadrant III and Quadrant IV.

We are told that Cosine is negative, which is Negative in Quadrant II and
Quandrant III.

Therefore we know that our Angle/Point lies in Quadrant III (both $y$ and $x$
will be negative, but the Tangent will be positive).

We should be explicit about the Domain of our Angle then:

$$ \pi < \theta < \frac{3\pi}{2} $$

Now, we should be able to determine Cosecant and Tangent from this using the
Pythagorean Theorem:

$$ y^2 + x^2 = r^2 $$

Just keep in mind that because we have determined that both $y$ and $x$ will be
negative, this means that when we evaluate Sine, $r$ must be positive:

$$ \sin\theta = \frac{y}{r} $$

$$ \sin\theta = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} $$

$$ \sin\theta = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{5}} $$

$$ y = -1 $$

$$ r = \sqrt{5} $$

$$ y^2 + x^2 = r^2 $$

$$ (-1)^2 + x^2 = (\sqrt{5})^2 $$

$$ 1 + x^2 = 5 $$

$$ x^2 = 4 $$

$$ x = \pm 2 $$

And we know $x$ must be negative so:

$$ x = -2 $$

And from here we can determine $\cos\theta$ and also $\tan\theta$:

$$ \cos\theta = \frac{x}{r} $$

$$ \cos\theta = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{5}} $$

$$ \cos\theta = -\frac{2\sqrt{5}}{5} $$

$$ \tan\theta = \frac{y}{x} $$

$$ \tan\theta = \frac{-1}{-2} $$

$$ \tan\theta = \frac{1}{2} $$

---

We can now use the following to solve some Double/Half Angle Formulas:

$$ \sin\theta = -\frac{\sqrt{5}}{5} $$

$$ \cos\theta = -\frac{2\sqrt{5}}{5} $$

$$ \tan\theta = \frac{1}{2} $$

---

$$ \sin(2\theta) = \text{ ?} $$

$$ \sin(2\theta) = 2\sin\theta\cos\theta $$

$$ \sin(2\theta) = 2\left(-\frac{\sqrt{5}}{5}\right)\left(-\frac{2\sqrt{5}}{5}\right) $$

$$ \sin(2\theta) = 2\left(\frac{10}{25}\right) $$

$$ \sin(2\theta) = 2\left(\frac{2}{5}\right) $$

$$ \boxed{\sin(2\theta) = \frac{4}{5}} $$

---

$$ \cos(2\theta) = \text{ ?} $$

$$ \cos(2\theta) = \cos^2\theta - \sin^2\theta $$

$$ \cos(2\theta) = \left(-\frac{2\sqrt{5}}{5}\right)^2 - \left(-\frac{\sqrt{5}}{5}\right)^2 $$

$$ \cos(2\theta) = \left(\frac{20}{25}\right) - \left(\frac{5}{25}\right) $$

$$ \cos(2\theta) = \frac{15}{25} $$

$$ \boxed{\cos(2\theta) = \frac{3}{5}} $$

---

$$ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = \text{ ?} $$

$$ \sin\left(\dfrac{\theta}{2}\right) = \pm \sqrt{\dfrac{1 - \cos\theta}{2}} $$

$$ \sin\left(\dfrac{\theta}{2}\right) = \pm \sqrt{\dfrac{1 - \left(-\dfrac{2\sqrt{5}}{5}\right)}{2}} $$

$$ \sin\left(\dfrac{\theta}{2}\right) = \pm \sqrt{\dfrac{\dfrac{5 + 2\sqrt{5}}{5}}{2}} $$

$$ \sin\left(\dfrac{\theta}{2}\right) = \pm \sqrt{\frac{5 + 2\sqrt{5}}{10}} $$

If we consider where in our graph $\dfrac{\theta}{2}$ lies, we have to divide
our entire Domain by $2$:

$$ \frac{\pi}{2} < \frac{\theta}{2} < \frac{3\pi}{4} $$

Ah, we are now in Quadrant II, not Quadrant III. This is why it's good to
consider how our Domain changes whenever we evaluate Half-Angle Formulas. This
means that our $y$ is positive and our $x$ is negative. Therefore our Sine Half
Formula evaluates to positive:

$$ \boxed{\sin\left(\dfrac{\theta}{2}\right) = \sqrt{\frac{5 + 2\sqrt{5}}{10}}} $$

---

$$ \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = \text{ ?} $$

$$ \cos\left(\dfrac{\theta}{2}\right) = \pm \sqrt{\dfrac{1 + \cos\theta}{2}} $$

$$ \cos\left(\dfrac{\theta}{2}\right) = \pm \sqrt{\dfrac{1 + \left(-\dfrac{2\sqrt{5}}{5}\right)}{2}} $$

$$ \cos\left(\dfrac{\theta}{2}\right) = \pm \sqrt{\dfrac{\dfrac{5 - 2\sqrt{5}}{5}}{2}} $$

$$ \cos\left(\dfrac{\theta}{2}\right) = \pm \sqrt{\frac{5 - 2\sqrt{5}}{10}} $$

And because we know from our previous problem that we are in Quadrant II, we
know that $x$ is negative, therefore:

$$ \boxed{\cos\left(\dfrac{\theta}{2}\right) = -\sqrt{\frac{5 - 2\sqrt{5}}{10}}} $$

---

$$ \tan(2\theta) = \text{ ?} $$

$$ \tan(2\theta) = \dfrac{2\tan\theta}{1 - \tan^2\theta} $$

$$ \tan(2\theta) = \dfrac{2\left(\dfrac{1}{2}\right)}{1 - \left(\dfrac{1}{2}\right)^2} $$

$$ \tan(2\theta) = \dfrac{1}{1 - \left(\dfrac{1}{4}\right)} $$

$$ \tan(2\theta) = \dfrac{1}{\dfrac{3}{4}} $$

$$ \boxed{\tan(2\theta) = \frac{4}{3}} $$

As an aside, if you consider that:

$$ \tan(2\theta) = \frac{\sin(2\theta)}{\cos(2\theta)} $$

And we plug in our two Double Angle Formulas from before:

$$ \tan(2\theta) = \frac{\dfrac{4}{5}}{\dfrac{3}{5}} $$

$$ \tan(2\theta) = \frac{4}{5} \cdot \frac{5}{3} $$

We get the same answer:

$$ \tan(2\theta) = \frac{4}{3} $$

---

$$ \tan\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = \text{ ?} $$

$$ \tan\left(\dfrac{\theta}{2}\right) = \pm \sqrt{\dfrac{1 - \cos\theta}{1 + \cos\theta}} $$

$$ \tan\left(\dfrac{\theta}{2}\right) = \pm \sqrt{\dfrac{1 - \left(-\dfrac{2\sqrt{5}}{5}\right)}{1 + \left(-\dfrac{2\sqrt{5}}{5}\right)}} $$

$$ \tan\left(\dfrac{\theta}{2}\right) = \pm \sqrt{\frac{\dfrac{5 + 2\sqrt{5}}{5}}{\dfrac{5 - 2\sqrt{5}}{5}}} $$

$$ \tan\left(\dfrac{\theta}{2}\right) = \pm \sqrt{\frac{5 + 2\sqrt{5}}{5} \cdot \frac{5}{5 - 2\sqrt{5}}} $$

$$ \tan\left(\dfrac{\theta}{2}\right) = \pm \sqrt{\frac{5 + 2\sqrt{5}}{5 - 2\sqrt{5}}} $$

And because we know $\dfrac{\theta}{2}$ lies in Quadrant II, we know that $x$ is
negative and $y$ is positive, therefore tangent must be negative:

$$ \boxed{\tan\left(\dfrac{\theta}{2}\right) = -\sqrt{\frac{5 + 2\sqrt{5}}{5 - 2\sqrt{5}}}} $$

---

Let's now deal with a few more awkward angles. Consider the following:

$$ \cos(22.5\degree) $$

Now this is awkward and this is not on the Unit Circle. But if we rewrite this
as a Double or Half Angle Formula, we can potentially evaluate this further and
get an exact answer of what this would be.

Let's say:

$$ \theta = 45\degree $$

Well, then:

$$ \frac{\theta}{2} = 22.5\degree $$

Well we have a formula for that:

$$ \cos\left(\dfrac{\theta}{2}\right) = \pm \sqrt{\frac{1 + \cos\theta}{2}} $$

If we then substitute our angle in:

$$ \cos\left(\dfrac{45}{2}\right) = \pm \sqrt{\frac{1 + \cos(45)}{2}} $$

Well $45\degree$ is on the Unit Circle, we know that
$\cos(45) = \dfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$. This means we can evaluate this as:

$$ \cos\left(\dfrac{45}{2}\right) = \pm \sqrt{\frac{1 + \left(\dfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)}{2}} $$

$$ \cos\left(\dfrac{45}{2}\right) = \pm \sqrt{\frac{\dfrac{2 + \sqrt{2}}{2}}{2}} $$

$$ \cos\left(\dfrac{45}{2}\right) = \pm \sqrt{\frac{2 + \sqrt{2}}{4}} $$

And we know that 22.5\degree is in Quadrant I because it is less than 90\degree.
Therefore this solution must be positive:

$$ \boxed{\cos\left(\dfrac{45}{2}\right) = \sqrt{\frac{2 + \sqrt{2}}{4}}} $$

---

$$ \tan\left(\frac{9\pi}{8}\right) = \text{ ?} $$

Getting this into our first Period is probably preferable, let's subtract by
$\pi$:

$$ \frac{9\pi}{8} - \frac{8\pi}{8} = \frac{\pi}{8} $$

$$ \tan\left(\frac{9\pi}{8}\right) = \tan\left(\frac{\pi}{8}\right) $$

If we think of:

$$ \theta = \frac{\pi}{8} $$

Then:

$$ \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{\pi}{4} $$

We can use this along with our Tangent Half Angle Formula to Evaluate this:

$$ \tan\left(\dfrac{\left(\dfrac{\pi}{4}\right)}{2}\right) = \pm \sqrt{\dfrac{1 - \cos\left(\dfrac{\pi}{4}\right)}{1 + \cos\left(\dfrac{\pi}{4}\right)}} $$

$$ \tan\left(\dfrac{\left(\dfrac{\pi}{4}\right)}{2}\right) = \pm \sqrt{\dfrac{1 - \left(\dfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)}{1 + \left(\dfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)}}$$

$$ \tan\left(\dfrac{\left(\dfrac{\pi}{4}\right)}{2}\right) = \pm \sqrt{\dfrac{\dfrac{2 - \sqrt{2}}{2}}{\dfrac{2 + \sqrt{2}}{2}}}$$

$$ \tan\left(\dfrac{\left(\dfrac{\pi}{4}\right)}{2}\right) = \pm \sqrt{\frac{2 - \sqrt{2}}{2 + \sqrt{2}}}$$

We also know we are in Quadrant I given the small positive angle, so this answer
is also positive:

$$ \boxed{\tan\left(\dfrac{\left(\dfrac{\pi}{4}\right)}{2}\right) = \sqrt{\frac{2 - \sqrt{2}}{2 + \sqrt{2}}}} $$

---

## Double Angle Identities

Consider the following:

$$ \cos^4\theta - \sin^4\theta = \cos(2\theta) $$

Let's try and prove this is true.

There are many ways to think about this, but perhaps the best thing to do is
factor it:

$$ (\cos^2\theta)^2 - (\sin^2\theta)^2 = \cos(2\theta) $$

And we can further factor this using a standard Difference of Squares formula:

$$ x^2 - y^2 = (x - y)(x + y) $$

$$ (\cos^2\theta - \sin^2\theta)(\cos^2\theta + \sin^2\theta) = \cos(2\theta) $$

Here we have some known identities now:

We know that:

$$ \cos^2\theta + \sin^2\theta = 1 $$

Via the Pythagorean Identity!

And we also know from our previous lecture that one of our Cosine Double
Identities is:

$$ \cos(2\theta) = \cos^2\theta - \sin^2\theta $$

Thusly we have:

$$ (\cos(2\theta))(1) = \cos(2\theta) $$

$$ \boxed{\cos(2\theta) = \cos(2\theta)} $$

---

Let's prove this one:

$$ \cos^2(2\theta) - \sin^2(2\theta) = \cos(4\theta) $$

If we consider that:

$$ \cos(2\theta) = \cos^2\theta - \sin^2\theta $$

Then this extremely similar looking problem can be resolved rather simply.

$$ \cos^2(2\theta) - \sin^2(2\theta) = \cos(2 \cdot 2\theta) $$

$$ \cos^2(2\theta) - \sin^2(2\theta) = \cos(4\theta) $$

$$ \cos(4\theta) = \cos(4\theta) $$

Admittedly, Professor Leonard went pretty quickly through this one and I don't
quite understand it at the time of this writing.

---

**More Practice**

Let's now evaluate some further equations.

For all the following, think of the Domain as lying between:

$$ 0 \leq \theta \leq 2\pi $$

The entire first Period.

---

$$ \cos(2\theta) + 6\sin^2\theta = 4 $$

Let's use the Cosine Double Angle Formula that involves Sine.

$$ \cos(2\theta) = 1 - 2\sin^2\theta $$

$$ 1 - 2\sin^2\theta + 6\sin^2\theta = 4 $$

$$ 1 + 4\sin^2\theta = 4 $$

Now we can isolate our Trigonometric Function and take the Square Root of both
sides:

$$ 4\sin^2\theta = 3 $$

$$ \sin^2\theta = \frac{3}{4} $$

$$ \sin\theta = \pm \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} $$

$$ \sin\theta = \pm \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} $$

To be clear we evaluate both positive and negative since we are in a whole
Period:

$$ \sin\theta = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} $$

If this is the case, then we are in Quadrant I or II, and this evaluates, via
the Unit Circle to:

$$ \theta = \frac{\pi}{3} \text{, } \frac{2\pi}{3} $$

$$ \sin\theta = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} $$

$$ \theta = \frac{4\pi}{3} \text{, } \frac{5\pi}{3} $$

So, in solving for $\theta$, we get four solutions:

$$ \boxed{\theta = \frac{\pi}{3} \text{, } \frac{2\pi}{3} \text{, } \theta = \frac{4\pi}{3} \text{, } \frac{5\pi}{3}} $$

---

$$ \cos(2\theta) = \cos\theta $$

Considering which Cosine Double Angle Formula matches up best with
$\cos(2\theta)$, we'll probably choose the one with just another cosine:

$$ \cos(2\theta) = 2\cos^2\theta - 1 $$

$$ 2\cos^2\theta - 1 = \cos\theta $$

This is looking like a Quadratic Formula, let's move it all to one side and
factor:

$$ 2\cos^2\theta - \cos\theta - 1 = 0 $$

$$ (2\cos\theta + 1)(\cos\theta - 1) = 0 $$

$$ 2\cos\theta + 1 = 0 $$

$$ 2\cos\theta = -1 $$

$$ \cos\theta = -\frac{1}{2} $$

$$ \cos\theta - 1 = 0 $$

$$ \cos\theta = 1 $$

So let's evaluate our Angles.

Where is $\cos\theta = -\dfrac{1}{2}$ ?

There are two angles where this is true on the Unit circle in Quadrant II and
Quadrant III:

$$ \theta = \frac{2\pi}{3} \text{, } \frac{4\pi}{3} $$

And then we also have $\cos\theta = 1$

There is only one point where this is true, and that is:

$$ \theta = 0 $$

Therefore we have three answers:
$$ \boxed{\theta = \frac{2\pi}{3} \text{, } \frac{4\pi}{3} \text{, } 0} $$

---

$$ \sin(2\theta) = \cos\theta $$

There isn't really multiple Double Angle Formulas for this, only the Sine one
works:

$$ \sin(2\theta) = 2\sin\theta\cos\theta $$

$$ 2\sin\theta\cos\theta = \cos\theta $$

You might be tempted to divide by $\cos\theta$, but this might be a problem
considering $\cos\theta = 0$ would cause undefined behavior. Let's not do that
and instead try and factor this:

$$ 2\sin\theta\cos\theta - \cos\theta = 0 $$

$$ \cos\theta(2\sin\theta - 1) = 0 $$

$$ \cos\theta = 0 $$

$$ 2\sin\theta - 1 = 0 $$

$$ 2\sin\theta = 1 $$

$$ \sin\theta = \frac{1}{2} $$

If $\cos\theta = 0$, there's two angles on which that occurs:

$$ \theta = \frac{\pi}{2} \text{, } \frac{3\pi}{2} $$

And for $\sin\theta = \frac{1}{2}$, two angles on which that occurs are:

$$ \theta = \frac{\pi}{6} \text{, } \frac{5\pi}{6} $$

Therefore our answers are:
$$ \boxed{\theta = \frac{\pi}{2} \text{, } \frac{3\pi}{2} \text{, } \frac{\pi}{6} \text{, } \frac{5\pi}{6}} $$
