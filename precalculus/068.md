In the previous lecture, we discussed how an Arithmetic Sequence is simply a
list of numbers that are added over and over again.

It should therefore be possible to use a method that predictably adds up a
finite subset of our sequence.

Note in the following that we have an arithmetic sequence being passed to a
summation expression:

For Some:

$$ S_n = a_1 + a_2 + \text{ ... } + a_n $$

There exists a sum:

$$ \sum^{n}_{k = 1}\left[a_1 + (k - 1)d\right] = \frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n) $$

---

$$ 60 + 64 + 68n + 72 + \text{ ... } + 120 $$

Let's say we wanted to add up this sequence, but we didn't want to list out all
of the terms.

Let's first build our sequence:

$$
\begin{align*}
a_1 = 60 \\
a_n = 120 \\
d = 4 \\
\end{align*}
$$

We can use the above to derive an Arithmetic Sequence using the _Arithmetic
Sequence Formula_.

$$ a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d $$

From here, we can plug in our values and determine how many terms, $n$, we have.

$$ 120 = 60 + (n - 1)(4) $$

$$ 120 = 60 + 4n - 4 $$

$$ 120 = 4n + 56 $$

$$ 120 = 4n + 56 $$

$$ 120 = 4n + 56 $$

$$ 64 = 4n $$

$$ n = 16 $$

We can then take the simplified form of our _Arithmetic Sequence Formula_ and
plug that in as our summation argument, and then use the _Arithmetic Sequence_
Formula to solve:

$$ \sum^{n}_{k = 1}\left[a_1 + (k - 1)d\right] = \frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n) $$

$$ \sum^{16}_{k = 1}{4k + 56} = \frac{16}{2}(60 + 120) $$

$$ \sum^{16}_{k = 1}{4k + 56} = 1440 $$
