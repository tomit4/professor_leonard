We have already covered some basic Trigonometric Identities. In this section,
we're going to review some of these identities as well as go into depth as to
how they can be utilized to solve some sometimes difficult to understand
mathematical expressions.

---

We'll now simply list out the Identities we've covered thus far. You'll be
surprised as to how many you have probably already used in previous lectures.

$$ \tan\theta = \frac{\sin\theta}{\cos\theta} $$

$$ \cot\theta = \frac{\cos\theta}{\sin\theta} \text{, } \cot\theta = \frac{1}{\tan\theta} $$

$$ \csc\theta = \frac{1}{\sin\theta} \text{, } \sec\theta = \frac{1}{\cos\theta} $$

$$
\begin{align*}
\sin^2\theta + \cos^2\theta = 1 \text{,}\\
\tan^2\theta + 1 = \sec^2\theta{,} \\
\cot^2\theta + 1 = \csc^2\theta
\end{align*}
$$

$$ \sin(-\theta) = -\sin\theta \text{, } \tan(-\theta) = -\tan\theta \text{, } \cos(-\theta) = \cos\theta $$

$$ \csc(-\theta) = -\csc\theta \text{, } \cot(-\theta) = -\cot\theta \text{, } \sec(-\theta) = \sec\theta $$

Let's now practice just simplifying some Trigonometric Function expressions

---

Simplify:

$$ \tan\theta\csc\theta $$

Now, there are a series of generalized rules (but not hard steps) to evaluating
these sorts of expressions. One of the most simple ways you can try to simplify
these expressions is to simply express them as both Sine and Cosine:

$$ \frac{\sin\theta}{\cos\theta} \cdot \frac{1}{\sin\theta} $$

The sines cancel and we are left with:

$$ \frac{1}{\cos\theta} $$

Which is just:

$$ \boxed{\sec\theta} $$

---

Simplify:

$$ \frac{\sin\theta + \cos\theta}{\cos\theta} + \frac{\cos\theta - \sin\theta}{\sin\theta} $$

Getting a common denominator is a good idea here:

$$ \left(\frac{\sin\theta}{\sin\theta}\right)\left(\frac{\sin\theta + \cos\theta}{\cos\theta}\right) + \left(\frac{\cos\theta - \sin\theta}{\sin\theta}\right)\left(\frac{\cos\theta}{\cos\theta}\right) $$

$$ \frac{\sin\theta(\sin\theta + \cos\theta) + \cos\theta(\cos\theta - \sin\theta)}{\sin\theta\cos\theta} $$

$$ \frac{\sin^2\theta + \cos\theta\sin\theta + \cos^2\theta - \cos\theta\sin\theta}{\sin\theta\cos\theta} $$

$$ \frac{\sin^2\theta + \cos^2\theta}{\sin\theta\cos\theta} $$

$$ \frac{1}{\sin\theta\cos\theta} $$

One might continue on here, but this is relatively well simplified. One thing
you could do is also express this as:

$$ \frac{1}{\sin\theta} \cdot \frac{1}{\cos\theta} $$

Which would then be:

$$ \csc\theta\sec\theta $$

But this isn't inherently necessary.

---

Simplify:

$$ \frac{\cos^2\theta - 1}{\cos^2\theta - \cos\theta} $$

You can probably factor here:

$$ \frac{(\cos\theta + 1)(\cos\theta - 1)}{\cos\theta(\cos\theta - 1)} $$

$$ \frac{\cos\theta + 1}{\cos\theta} $$

$$ \frac{\cos\theta + 1}{1} \cdot \frac{1}{\cos\theta} $$

$$ \left(\frac{1}{\cos\theta}\right)(\cos\theta + 1) $$

$$ \frac{\cos\theta}{\cos\theta} + \frac{1}{\cos\theta} $$

$$ 1 + \sec\theta $$
