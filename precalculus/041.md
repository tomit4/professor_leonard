This section will be brief, but it is here to complete our understanding of _End
Behavior Of Rational Functions_. Recall that in our previous two sections on
_Horizontal Asymptotes_ and _Oblique Asymptotes_, that we determine if there are
these kinds of Asymptotes based off of the value of the _Leading Degrees_ of our
Numerators and Denominators of our Rational Functions and how they relate to
each other. There is one case we didn't cover (sort of) though:

What happens if the _Degree Of The Numerator_ is _Larger Than_ The _Degree Of
The Denominator_ by **More than $1$**.

Let's just evaluate what happens in this case with an example:

---

**Example**

$$ g(x) = \frac{4x^5 - 7x + 1}{x^3 + 1} $$

Once again, if we simplify our leading terms, we can approximate our end
behavior:

$$ g(x) \approx \frac{4x^5}{x^3} $$

In this case, our denominator cancels out after simplified:

$$ g(x) \approx \frac{4x^5}{x^3} \rightarrow g(x) \approx 4x^2 $$

Now, as you can see, we simply have an _Even Power Function_. This means that we
will have a graph that has two lines that are symmetric along the $y$-axis and
spread out and get smaller as $x$ gets larger (and in this case, never enter the
third and fourth quadrants because $f(x)$ can never be less than or equal to
$0$).

This _End Behavior_ can be expressed as:

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{As } x \rightarrow \infty \text{ , } g(x) \rightarrow \infty \\
\text{and as } x \rightarrow -\infty \text{ , } g(x) \rightarrow \infty \\
\end{align*}
$$
