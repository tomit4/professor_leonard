Angles can be measured using traditional mathematical Decimal Notation, but
oftentimes other forms of precision are used for the sake of convenience (for
example, in Geography).

Thusly a sexagesimal (base-60) system is sometimes used with the denotation of
Minutes, denoted by a single apostrophe, $'$, and Seconds, denoted by a double
apostrophe, $''$.

In essence, Minutes/Seconds are _Fractions_ of a Degree.

$$
\begin{align*}
1 \text{ Revolution } = 360\degree \\
1\degree = 60 \text{ Minutes : } 60' \\
1\text{'} = 60 \text{ Seconds: } 60'' \\
\end{align*}
$$

Please note that these unites of measurement are _Exceptionally Small_, and
while we might see Angles denoted using Minutes, it is somewhat rare to see
Angles denoted using Seconds.

## Converting Degrees To Decimals

$$
\begin{align*}
1\degree = 60' \text{ or } 1' = \frac{1}{60}\degree \\
1' = 60" \text{ or } 1'' = \frac{1}{60}' \\
1'' = \frac{1}{60} \cdot \frac{1}{60}\degree
\end{align*}
$$

**Ex.**

With the above in mind, let's now convert the following Angle measurement into a
decimal:

$$ 61\degree42'21'' $$

$$ 41' = 42 \cdot \frac{1}{60}\degree $$

$$ 21'' = 21 \cdot \frac{1}{60} \cdot \frac{1}{60}\degree $$

Ultimately you would then plug this into your calculator to get the decimal
conversion. Let's write this out as one line to show exactly what you're doing:

$$ 61\degree42'21'' = 61\degree + 42 \cdot \frac{1}{60}\degree + 21 \cdot \frac{1}{60} \cdot \frac{1}{60}\degree $$

$$ 61\degree42'21'' = 61.70583\degree $$

Now, which is better? It depends on your application, note that our original
measurement in sexagesimal notation is a bit easier to read, but again, it
really depends on what the application is which will determine which notation to
use.

Convert the following to decimal notation:

$$ 101\degree3'51'' $$

$$ 3' = 3 \cdot \frac{1}{60}\degree $$

$$ 51'' = 51 \cdot \frac{1}{60} \cdot \frac{1}{60}\degree $$

$$ 101\degree3'51'' = 101\degree + 3 \cdot \frac{1}{60}\degree + 51 \cdot \frac{1}{60} \cdot \frac{1}{60}\degree $$

$$ 101\degree3'51'' = 101.0641667\degree $$

## Converting Decimals To Degrees

Consider the following decimal notation of an Angle:

$$ 18.255\degree $$

How can we convert this to Minutes/Seconds (_i.e._ sexagesimal notation)?

$$ 18.255\degree = 18\degree + 0.255\degree $$

Consider this separate decimal can be converted by simply multiplying by 60 for
Minutes:

$$
\begin{align*}
0.255\degree = 0.255 \cdot 1\degree \\
0.255\degree = 0.255 \cdot 60' \\
\end{align*}
$$

When we plug in this calculation we get:

$$ 18.255\degree = 18\degree + 15.3' $$

And of course, this is closer to our final conversion, but of course, we still
have decimal notation for our Minutes, which, again, we can extrapolate out:

$$ 18.255\degree = 18\degree + 15' + 0.3' $$

And convert again:

$$
\begin{align*}
0.3' = 0.3 \cdot 1' \\
0.3' = 0.3 \cdot 60'' \\
\end{align*}
$$

Which when calculated gives us $18''$, and thusly we have:

$$ 18\degree15'18'' $$

Convert the following Angle from Decimal Notation to
Minutes/Seconds(sexagesimal) Notation:

$$ 29.411\degree $$

$$ 29\degree + 0.411\degree $$

$$ 29\degree + 0.411 \cdot 60' $$

$$ 29\degree + 24.66' $$

$$ 29\degree + 24' + 0.66' $$

$$ 29\degree + 24' + 0.66 \cdot 60'' $$

$$ 29\degree + 24' + 39.6'' $$

Now, typically, when we get a decimal in the seconds place, we will round this,
which inherently means that our decimal notation of this angle will be less
accurate:

$$ 29\degree24'40'' $$
