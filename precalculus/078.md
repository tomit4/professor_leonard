In this section, we are going to dive a little deeper on the topic of the _Unit
Circle_. We're going to explore some common angles that show up often when
evaluating _Trigonometric Functions_ and their relations on the _Unit Circle_.

It is _highly recommended_ that you _memorize the diagram above! By the time you
get to Calculus, you'll want to know these values like the back of your hand.

Let's first review how do you find an angle on the _Unit Circle_.

In the previous section, we were able to easily determine some of the most
common Points on a Unit Circle, based off the angle in radians (_i.e._
$0$/$2\pi$, $\dfrac{\pi}{2}$, $\pi$, and $\dfrac{3\pi}{2}$). But let's say we
were given an angle in radians:

$$ \theta = \frac{2\pi}{3} $$

This also can be referenced in degrees as:

$$ \theta = 120\degree $$

We'll generally be using radians throughout this lecture, but you should know
that when given degrees, we can easily convert them to find any of our
_Trigonometric Function_ values.

If we consult our _Unit Circle_ chart, we can see that the point on the _Unit
Circle_ at this angle, $\theta$, is:

Point: $\left(-\dfrac{1}{2}, \dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)$

Thusly we can start to evaluate our 6 _Trigonometric Functions_:

$$
\begin{align*}
\sin \frac{2\pi}{3} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\\
\cos \frac{2\pi}{3} = -\frac{1}{2} \\
\tan \frac{2\pi}{3} = -\sqrt{3} \\
\csc \frac{2\pi}{3} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \rightarrow \frac{2 \cdot \sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3} \cdot \sqrt{3}}\rightarrow \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3} \\
\sec \frac{2\pi}{3} = -2 \\
\cot \frac{2\pi}{3} = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \rightarrow -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} \\
\end{align*}
$$

---

Consider the following angle:

$$ \theta = \frac{8\pi}{3} \text{, } 480\degree $$

We can easily see that this goes over one full revolution. In fact if we
evaluate this further, we can see:

$$ \theta = 2\pi + \frac{2\pi}{3} $$

This means we go around one full revolution and end up at the same angle of our
previous example, $\dfrac{2\pi}{3}$, and this means we would have the same
point, $\left(-\dfrac{1}{2}, \dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)$, and the same values
for our _Trigonometric Functions_.

When we get to our lectures on Graphing Trigonometric Functions, you'll notice
that the graph will oscillate whenever we have a repetition of these values,
this is known as a _Period_ of these Trigonometric Function's values.

Let's continue finding the _Trigonometric Function_ values of some common _Unit
Circle_ Angles:

$$ \theta = \frac{\pi}{45} \text{ , } 45\degree $$

Point: $\left(\dfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \dfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)$

$$
\begin{align*}
\sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \\
\cos \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \\
\tan \frac{\pi}{4} = 1 \\
\csc \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{2}} \rightarrow \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{2} \rightarrow \sqrt{2} \\
\sec \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{2}} \rightarrow \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{2} \rightarrow \sqrt{2} \\
\cot \frac{\pi}{4} = 1 \\
\end{align*}
$$

---

$$ \theta = \frac{7\pi}{6} \text{ , } 210\degree $$

Point: $\left(-\dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, -\dfrac{1}{2}\right)$

$$
\begin{align*}
\sin \frac{7\pi}{6} = -\frac{1}{2} \\
\cos \frac{7\pi}{6} = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\
\tan \frac{7\pi}{6} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \rightarrow \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} \\
\csc \frac{7\pi}{6} = -2 \\
\sec \frac{7\pi}{6} = -\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \rightarrow -\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3} \\
\cot \frac{7\pi}{6} = \sqrt{3} \\
\end{align*}
$$

---

$$ \theta = \frac{5\pi}{3} \text{ , } 300\degree $$

Point: $\left(\dfrac{1}{2}, -\dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)$

$$
\begin{align*}
\sin \frac{5\pi}{3} = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\
\cos \frac{5\pi}{3} = \frac{1}{2} \\
\tan \frac{5\pi}{3} = -\sqrt{3} \\
\csc \frac{5\pi}{3} = -\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \rightarrow -\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3} \\
\sec \frac{5\pi}{3} = 2 \\
\cot \frac{5\pi}{3} = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \rightarrow -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} \\
\end{align*}
$$

---

$$ \theta = -\frac{3\pi}{4} \text{ , } -135\degree $$

Point: $\left(-\dfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, -\dfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)$

$$
\begin{align*}
\sin -\frac{3\pi}{4} = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \\
\cos -\frac{3\pi}{4} = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \\
\tan -\frac{3\pi}{4} = 1 \\
\csc -\frac{3\pi}{4} = -\frac{2}{\sqrt{2}} \rightarrow -\frac{2\sqrt{2}}{2} \rightarrow -\sqrt{2} \\
\sec -\frac{3\pi}{4} = -\frac{2}{\sqrt{2}} \rightarrow -\frac{2\sqrt{2}}{2} \rightarrow -\sqrt{2} \\
\cot -\frac{3\pi}{4} = 1 \\
\end{align*}
$$

Let's now do some edge cases:

---

$$ \tan 6\pi = $$

This is just 3 full revolutions around our Unit Circle, thusly:

$$ \tan 6\pi = \tan 2\pi = \tan 0 $$

Which is just $\dfrac{y}{x}$, and thusly we get:

$$ \tan 6\pi = 0 $$

---

$$ \sec(-\pi) = $$

$$ \sec(-\pi) = \sec(\pi) $$

$$ \cos(\pi) = \frac{-1}{1} = -1 $$

$$ \sec(-\pi) = \frac{1}{-1} = -1 $$

$$ \sec(-\pi) = -1 $$

---

$$ \sin \frac{11\pi}{2} = $$

$$ \sin \frac{11\pi}{2} = \sin \frac{3\pi}{2} $$

Point: $(0, -1)$

$$ \sin \frac{11\pi}{2} = -1 $$

---

$$ \sin(45\degree) + \cos(60\degree) \rightarrow $$

$$ \sin(45\degree) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} $$

$$ \cos(60\degree) = \frac{1}{2} $$

$$ \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = \boxed{\frac{1 + \sqrt{2}}{2}} $$

---

$$ \csc(45\degree)\tan(60\degree) \rightarrow $$

$$ \sin(45\degree) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} $$

$$ \csc(45\degree) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{2}} \rightarrow \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{2} \rightarrow \sqrt{2} $$

$$ \tan(60\degree) = \sqrt{3} $$

$$ \csc(45\degree)\tan(60\degree) \rightarrow \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{3} \rightarrow \boxed{\sqrt{6}} $$

---

$$ 3\csc\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + \cot\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) \rightarrow $$

$$ \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} $$

$$ \csc\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \rightarrow \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3} $$

$$ \tan\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) \rightarrow 1 $$

$$ \cot\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) \rightarrow 1 $$

$$ 3\left(\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3}\right) + 1 $$

$$ 3\csc\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + \cot\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) \rightarrow \boxed{2\sqrt{3} + 1} $$

---

$$ 2\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) + 3\tan\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) \rightarrow $$

$$ \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} $$

$$ \tan\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) = 1 $$

$$ 2\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) + 3(1) = \sqrt{2} + 3 $$

$$ 2\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) + 3\tan\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) \rightarrow \boxed{\sqrt{2} + 3} $$

---

Now, what happens if are asked to find one of these _Trigonometric Functions_ on
an angle that isn't within our Handy Dandy Unit Circle Cheat Sheet?

$$ \sin 28\degree \approx $$

$$ \cot \frac{\pi}{12} \approx $$

$$ \sin 1\degree \approx $$

$$ \sin 1 \approx $$

This is where you'd want to use your calculator, you just want to be sure you
are in the right _mode_ (_i.e._ radians or degrees).

$$ \sin 28\degree \approx 0.47 $$

$$ \cot \frac{\pi}{12} \approx 3.73 $$

$$ \sin 1\degree \approx 0.02 $$

$$ \sin 1 \approx 0.84 $$

These last two examples are simply pointing out that you should make absolutely
sure you are in the right _mode_.

Okay, but what if we want to determine some of these _Trigonometric Functions_
for a point that is _not_ on the _Unit Circle_? Suppose we have some angle
$\theta$ along the circle that has the following point on its circumference:

Point: $(-3, 4)$

If we draw this point out the graph, we get:

![image 078_2](./078_2.png)

Hopefully, you can see that we can determine the radius of the point from its
origin, recall pythagorean theorem:

$$ (-3)^2 + 4^2 = r^2 $$

$$ 25 = r^2 $$

$$ 5 = r $$

Note that we didn't include the $\pm$ here, as it is not relevant to the problem
we are trying to solve (the $\pm$ of a radius will show up when we get to _Polar
_Coordinates in a future lecture).

We can now solve for our _Trigonometric Functions_ using these values, we just
need to put all of our values over the radius.

Consider that if we had a _Unit Circle_ here, our sine for $\theta$ would be:

$$ \sin\theta = 4 $$

But consider that this is the $y$-coordinate _over_ our _radius_:

$$ \sin\theta = \frac{4}{\text{radius}} = \frac{4}{1} = 4 $$

But if our radius isn't $1$, then we actually have to plug that in:

$$ \sin\theta = \frac{4}{5} $$

This applies to all our other _Trigonometric Functions_. We can use this
knowledge to write out our Trigonometric functions now:

$$
\begin{align*}
\sin\theta = \frac{4}{5} \\
\\
\cos\theta = -\frac{3}{5} \\
\\
\tan\theta = -\frac{4}{3} \\
\\
\csc\theta = \frac{5}{4} \\
\\
\sec\theta = -\frac{5}{3} \\
\\
\cot\theta = -\frac{3}{4} \\
\\
\end{align*}
$$
