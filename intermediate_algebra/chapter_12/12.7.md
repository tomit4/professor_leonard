# 12.7: Solving Exponential and Logarithmic Equations

**Ex:**

$$ 3^x = 9 $$

$$ 3^x = 3^2 $$

$$ x = 2 $$

**Ex:**

$$ 25^x = 125^{x-2} $$

$$ (5^2)^x = (5^3)^{x-2}$$

$$ 5^{2x} = 5^{3(x-2)} $$

$$ 2x = 3(x-2) $$

$$ 2x = 3x - 6 $$

$$ 6 = x $$

---

**Ex:**

If you can find a common base, then you can solve for $x$. If you cannot find a
common base, then you have to represent it as a _Logarithm_.

$$ 3^x = 7 $$

$$ log3^x = log7 $$

$$ xlog3 = log7 $$

$$ x = \frac{log7}{log3} $$

---

**Notes:**

1. Try to find _Common Bases_.

2. If you can't, take a _Logarithm_ of both sides.

---

**Ex:**

$$ 2^x = 5 $$

$$ log2^x = log5 $$

$$ xlog2 = log5 $$

$$ x = \frac{log5}{log2} $$

---

**Ex:**

$$ 5^x = 9 $$

$$ log5^x = log9 $$

$$ xlog5 = log9 $$

$$ x = \frac{log9}{log5} $$

---

**Ex:**

$$ 5^(x - 1) = 9 $$

$$ log5^(x - 1) = log9 $$

$$ (x - 1)log5 = log9 $$

$$ x - 1 = \frac{log9}{log5} $$

$$ x = \frac{log9}{log5} + 1 $$

---

Now let's do the inverse (solving logarithms with exponentials)

First, write it as an exponential:

**Ex:**

$$ log_{4}(x - 2) = 2 $$

$$ 4^2 = x - 2 $$

$$ 16 = x - 2 $$

$$ 18 = x $$

---

**Ex:**

$$ log_{2}(x - 1) = 5 $$

$$ 2^5 = x - 1 $$

$$ 32 = x - 1 $$

$$ 33 = x $$

---

**Ex:**

$$ log_{6}x + log_{6}(x + 1) = 1 $$

$$ log_{6}(x(x + 1)) = 1 $$

$$ log_{6}(x^2 + x) = 1 $$

$$ 6^1 = x^2 + x $$

$$ 6 = x^2 + x $$

$$ 0 = x^2 + x - 6 $$

$$ 0 = (x + 3)(x - 2) $$

$$ x + 3 = 0, x - 2 = 0 $$

$$ x = -3, x = 2 $$

Note that inside of our logarithms can never be negative, This _doesn't_ mean
that $x$ cannot be negative, it means that whatever is inside of our logarithms
cannot be negative. So plug it in:

$$ log_{6}(-3) + log_{6}(-3 + 1) = 1 $$

In this case, yes, both $log_{6}(-3)$ and $log_{6}(-2)$ are both negative and
therefore $x \neq -3$. Our final solution is:

$$ x = 2 $$

**Steps:**

1. Write as _One Logarithm_ First, then as an _Exponential_.

2. The Inside of a _Log_ _CANNOT_ be _negative_.

---

**Ex:**

$$ log_{5}x + log_{5}(x + 4) = 1 $$

$$ log_{5}(x(x+4)) = 1 $$

$$ log_{5}(x^2 + 4x) = 1 $$

$$ 5^1 = x^2 + 4x $$

$$ 5 = x^2 + 4x $$

$$ 0 = x^2 + 4x - 5$$

$$ 0 = (x + 5)(x - 1) $$

$$ x + 5 = 0, x - 1 = 0 $$

$$ x = -5, x = 1 $$

The inside of both $log_{5}x$ and $log_{5}(x + 4)$ cannot be negative and $-5$
causes both of these to be negative, thusly $x \neq -5$. Our solution is:

$$ x = 1 $$

---

**Ex:**

$$ log(x - 1) - logx = 1 $$

$$ log(\frac{x - 1}{x}) = 1 $$

$$ 10^1 = \frac{x - 1}{x} $$

$$ 10 = \frac{x - 1}{x} $$

$$ 10x = x - 1 $$

$$ 9x = -1 $$

$$ x = -\frac{1}{9} $$

However, because $log(x - 1)$ and $logx$ both have a negative number inside when
we plug in $-\frac{1}{9}$ for $x$, this can only mean that $x \neq
-\frac{1}{9}$. And that means there is $\text{NO SOLUTION}$.

---

$$ log(x + 3) - logx = 1 $$

$$ log(\frac{x + 3}{x}) = 1 $$

$$ 10^1 = \frac{x + 3}{x} $$

$$ 10 = \frac{x + 3}{x} $$

$$ 10x = x + 3 $$

$$ 9x = 3 $$

$$ x = \frac{3}{9} $$

$$ x = \frac{1}{3} $$

And because both $log(x + 3)$ and $logx$ are positive when $\frac{1}{3}$ is
plugged in for $x$, our solution is indeed:

$$ x = \frac{1}{3} $$

---

**Ex:**

$$ ln5 + lnx = 0 $$

$$ ln5x = 0 $$

$$ e^0 = 5x $$

$$ 1 = 5x $$

$$ \frac{1}{5} = x $$

And since both $ln5$ and $lnx$ are positive when plugging in $\frac{1}{5}$ for
$x$, our solution is:

$$ \frac{1}{5} = x $$

**Ex:**

How long does it take to _double_ an investment of $\$1000$ at $6\%$ compounded
quarterly?

Firstly, which of the following formulas do we use?

$$ A = P(1 + \frac{r}{n})^{n \times T} $$

$$ A = Pe^{r \ times T} $$

The answer is the first formula, as that is used for any interest that is
_compounded_ at any rate _EXCEPT FOR CONTINUOUSLY_. We use:

$$ A = P(1 + \frac{r}{n})^{n \times T} $$

In this case.

$$ 2000 = 1000(1 + \frac{0.06}{4})^{4 \times T} $$

Note that we are solving for $T$, and also note that $A$ is equal to _Double_
our investment of $\$1000$.

$$ \frac{2000}{1000} = \frac{1000(1 + \frac{0.06}{4})^{4 \times T}}{1000}  $$

$$ 2 = (1 + \frac{0.06}{4})^{4T} $$

$$ 2 = (1.015)^{4T} $$

$$ log2 = log1.015^{4T} $$

$$ log2 = 4Tlog1.015 $$

$$ \frac{log2}{4log1.015} = T $$

$$ \frac{0.3010}{4(0.006466)} = T $$

$$ 11.64\text{ years} \approx T $$
